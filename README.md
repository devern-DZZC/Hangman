# Hangman
This is a hangman game using Python, where the user guesses letters to guess a randomly selected word. This application uses ASCII art to let the user have a smooth experience when playing the game. The words are randomly selected from a Python module.
This project helped me to build a solid foundation in Python Programming since it covered many key topics such as string manipulation, lists and modules.
